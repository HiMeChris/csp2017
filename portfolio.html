         <p>Bryan and I created a simple maze game. This is our first scratch project.
     The title is called Taco Bout A Maze because of the taco in the maze that acts on the point.
     The goal is to reach the end without touching the walls of the maze.</p>

     <p>Bryan and I also created through scratch, an interactive story. The story is 
     from the Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Control Goldilocks as she explores the house
     of the family of bears.</p>

    <p>Brett, Brant, and I created tic tac toe. We made it out of the M.I.T appinventor.
    We created a 4x4, 5x5, board and a scoreboard. All point tracking is done manually. And each time a
    player wins or ties, the players must also reset the board on their own.</p>

    <p>Jefferson and I created a simple interactive story. The interactive story takes place during World War 2.
    We used python to create the ineractive story. The goal is to command your unit to clear the bunker holding back the allies
    on D-day.</p>
